What I learnt so far - GIT_HUB
GitHub is a powerful platform for collaboration, enabling developers to work together on projects from different locations using features like pull requests and issues. It leverages Git for version control, ensuring detailed tracking of changes and facilitating branching and merging. GitHub also supports open-source contributions, helping developers learn, share, and showcase their work. Additionally, it integrates with various tools and offers security features to maintain safe and efficient workflows.
